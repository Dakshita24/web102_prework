## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It was challenging to use the reduce functions as I found them to be a bit confusing. But I felt overall, it was a valuable learning experience. The reduce function can be tricky 
because it requires a deep understanding of how data is accumulated and transformed through each iteration. I had to spend extra time grasping the concept and experimenting with 
different use cases to see how it could effectively simplify the code.
